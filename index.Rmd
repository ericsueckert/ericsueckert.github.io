Hi, welcome to my portfolio.

My name is Eric Eckert, 
You can find a summary of my github account [here](githubReport.html). It contains most of the projects I have done both in class and independantly. [Here](https://github.com/ericsueckert) is the link to my actual Github profile.


I have had some experience designing models with AutoCAD software. My best project is a simple model of a hidden blade inspired by the video game Assassin's Creed. 
You can view the design [here](https://grabcad.com/library/assassin-s-creed-hidden-blade-5).



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
