Hi, welcome to my portfolio.

You can find a summary of my github account [here](githubReport.html). It contains most of the projects I have done both in class and independantly.



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
